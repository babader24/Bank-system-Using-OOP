I created a simple banking system 
project in C++ that contains several 
interfaces on the console screen where 
you can create an account, add, delete, 
and update customer data. 

You can alsocontrol deposits and 
withdrawal of money from customer 
accounts or add users while giving 
permissions to each user.

This project relied on
object-orientedprogramming to organize 
the code and make it easier to read.
Object-oriented programming principles 
were used to hide some of the special 
codes that work behind the scenes 
from the programmers so that they would
not be a source of distraction when 
working on the project. Instead, they 
could be used as separate ready-made 
functions by simply calling the 
specified class.

There is a class for each screen or 
command separate from the program,
and the principle of inheritance has 
been applied to pass values ​​and data.

There are four main interfaces: 
the login screen, the main menu screen, 
the transactions screen, and the user 
Management and granting permissions
screen, All of them are inherited 
from the general screen for ease of 
setting titles and making changes in 
the future.

A new section for currencies has been 
added that contains conversion from the 
dollar to all currencies of the world

I also added a section for user login 
processes and an account of login 
transactions that are recorded in an 
external text file
